What are <a href="https://agrimetsoft.com/modis_products_extractor">MODIS Products</a>?
MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is an instrument on NASA's Terra (1999) and Aqua (2002) satellites, capturing data in multiple spectral bands and providing global Earth surface coverage every 1-2 days. It plays a crucial role in Earth observation, supporting scientific research, environmental monitoring, and natural resource management.

MODIS products refer to the diverse data sets derived from MODIS measurements, encompassing various aspects of Earth science:

Land Products: Include data on land cover, vegetation indices, land surface temperature, and surface reflectance.
Ocean Products: Provide information on ocean color, sea surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration, and ocean surface wind speed.
Atmosphere Products: Consist of data on cloud properties, aerosol optical thickness, water vapor content, and atmospheric temperature profiles.
Cryosphere Products: Offer data on snow cover, ice extent, and other cryospheric variables.
These MODIS products have greatly enhanced our understanding of Earth's systems and processes, facilitating the study of environmental phenomena on a global scale. They are freely accessible to the public and the scientific community, supporting a wide range of applications in climate research, environmental monitoring, and disaster management.
